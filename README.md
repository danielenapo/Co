# SERVERS 
This repos contains the servers needed to run the [AR client](https://github.com/danielenapo/tesi).<br>
They're based on the [IoT Course](https://github.com/Intelligent-Internet-of-Things-Course).<br>
There are at least two servers that you need to run. Both servers have to be on the same local network of the AR client device.
- [HTTP SERVER](https://github.com/danielenapo/Servers_Thesis/tree/main/laboratory-java-http-rest-api) -> it contains the informations about the CoAP servers, including the images to scan
- CoAP SERVERS -> IoT servers that use CoAP protocol. In this repos there are two examples: 
[Coffee machine](https://github.com/danielenapo/Servers_Thesis/tree/main/coffeMachine) and 
[Air conditioner](https://github.com/danielenapo/Servers_Thesis/tree/main/AirConditioner) (it's possible to run just one of them).
